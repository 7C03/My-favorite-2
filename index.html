  <section id="bio"><p> My favorite cartoon character Doraemon is the creation of Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. The duo were known by their pen name Fujiko Fujio.Doraemon is the name of a robot cat who is from 22 nd century. He travels back in time and comes to the house of Nobita Nobi to help him. He loves Dora cakes and he is scared of mouse. Doraemon has a pocket that has all the gadgets of his time and he uses them to help Nobita.The friends of Doraemon are Nobita, Shizuka, Gian and Suneo.</p>
      <div><p> I like Doraemon because he is so cute and funny and also it is science-fiction cartoon.I like all his gadgets and my most favorite gadget is Anywhere door.This is a very amazing creation and most loved character by children.I am watching Doraemon since when I was 2 years old and this character makes me very happy and I don't watch it like a cartoon it's like a emotion for me.</p></div></section>
